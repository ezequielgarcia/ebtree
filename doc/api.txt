2017-03-12 - EBTree API definition
----------------------------------

Concurrent accesses
-------------------

With the introduction of the support for re-entrant operations, it becomes
mandatory to clearly define the exposed API :
  - some functions will probably need to exist in locked and in unlocked form.
    For example, eb_insert_dup() might be called from within certain internal
    functions which already hold a lock while some application code makes use
    of it.

  - some functions will require knowledge of the root while it used not to be
    the case in the past (eg: eb_next, eb_first, eb_delete, ...)

It seems reasonable to consider that all __eb* variants will expect to be
called with whatever lock held, also saving some of them from needing access
to the root. Rare application code making use of these functions expects them
to be inlined and fast, and will very likely run under its own lock when
converted to multi-threading.

The code needs to be updated so that we don't call any non __eb* variant from
within the code.

All __eb* variants will have to be modified to support a root. This also means
that the eba_delete() API will have to change. However as long as we enforce
the fact that the root is not used in non-reentrant code, it is possible to
map eb32_delete(node) and friends to eba32_delete(NULL, node) for backwards
compatibility.


API Hierarchy
-------------

At the moment the mapping between the old an the new API looks like this :

      eb32   eb64   ebim   ebis   ebmb   ebpt   ebst   [Old user-facing API]
       |      |      |      |      |      |      |
     eba32  eba64  ebaim  ebais  ebamb  ebapt  ebast   [New user-facing API]
       |      |      |      |      |      |      |

API updates
-----------

{,__}eb{32,64,mb,pt,}_delete are defined to their {,__}eba*_delete equivalent.
{,__}eba{*}_delete are declared based on their {,__}ebx* generators.

  __ebx_delete() is static inline.
  ebx_delete() is a function.
  __ebx32_delete() is a static inline calling __ebx_delete()
  ebx32_delete() is a static inline calling ebx_delete()
  etc.

Eg for 32-bit, list of available inline functions :

static inline struct ebx32_node *ebx32_first(struct ebx_root *root)
  ==> not used internally, only exported

static inline struct ebx32_node *ebx32_last(struct ebx_root *root)
  ==> not used internally, only exported

static inline struct ebx32_node *ebx32_next(struct ebx32_node *eb32)
  ==> not used internally, only exported
  ==> needs to be adapted to take a root (down to ebx_next)

  ==> not used internally, only exported
  ==> needs to be adapted to take a root (down to ebx_prev)

Warning, ebxpt_lookup{,_le,_ge} relies on ebx{32,64}_* depending on the pointer
size.
